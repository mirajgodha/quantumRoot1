      <li><strong>Core Strength:</strong> Reactive systems trained to generate text and reason contextually</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Summarization, Q&A, content generation</li>
      <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> No real initiative or memory</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔹 AI Agents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Built on LLMs:</strong> Equipped with tools, memory, and purpose</li>
      <li><strong>Capabilities:</strong> Execute tasks, interact with APIs, follow multi-step workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Still require instructions and oversight</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔹 Agentic AI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Next-Level Intelligence:</strong> Reason, adapt, learn, and self-reflect</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Operates in dynamic environments with minimal human input</li>
      <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Coordinates with other agents to solve complex problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Autonomy Levels</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level 0–1:</strong> Basic automation and text generation</li>
      <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Task automation with human guidance</li>
      <li><strong>Level 3–4:</strong> Adaptive agents using memory and planning</li>
      <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> Fully autonomous, goal-driven systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
    <p>Agentic AI is already showing promise in areas like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customer support automation</li>
      <li>Code generation and debugging</li>
      <li>Financial analysis and reporting</li>
      <li>Enterprise workflow orchestration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>The true leap lies in <strong>multi-agent collaboration</strong> — networks of specialized agents solving real-world challenges together. Agentic AI marks a transformational phase in how organizations scale intelligence and operate autonomously.</p>
